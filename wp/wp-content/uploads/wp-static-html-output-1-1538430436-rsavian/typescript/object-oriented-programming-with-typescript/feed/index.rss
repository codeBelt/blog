Thanks for this helpful post.
Are you using &quot;bool&quot; instead of &quot;boolean&quot; in several places of your source code? I get an error when I try to compile :S]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Would be awesome if you could write a new tutorial or add a section that the describes the whole build process. We want to compile our project into one JS file yes, but we also want to minify that file and have a working source map to go with the minified file. Moreover, we want a declaration file. This is requirements all serious programmers should have. Yet I keep reading tutorials all over internet covering all kinds of topics yet only describing the first few baby steps one need to take.

Making the compiler output one single file with his source map and create a declaration file can be done from the GUI in latest Visual Studio. The tuff problem is to minify the file. How that affects the source map file, I don&#039;t know.

Thank you for sharing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome!

The syntax is closer to Java than C# with keywords like &#039;extends&#039; and &#039;implements&#039;. I worked with Script# and Saltarelle (C# to Javascript translators) and would like to know if there are any ways to translate C# to typescript.

Thanks Robert!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finally have time to start looking through you website typescript articles. Sorry if I spam you in advance! I refactored my project to use your structure but I am getting problems with &quot;this&quot; scoping.  For example I would get an error that window.turnOn does not exist. Therefor this appears to not reference the car but the window. I have no idea why this occurs but it appears to have something to do with lambda =&#062;. As I have just realised during this post, I am using a global setInterval function to start the car. Thus turnOn becomes window.turnOn....... And does not refer to the car class method. I currently do not understand scope here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks for the feedback. 

This is true you can have all your classes as single TS files and just reference them with ///&#060;reference path=&#039;folder/MyClass.ts&#039;/&gt;. Then type &quot;tsc --out main.js Main.ts&quot; which would be your top level class (Main.ts) and it will concatenate all your TypeScript files that are referenced in your classes into a single JavaScript file (main.js). Check out my &lt;a href=&quot;https://codebelt.github.io/blog/typescript/html5-canvas-banner-ads-with-greensock-tweening-and-typescript-tutorial/&quot; title=&quot;HTML5 Canvas Ad with TypeScript Tutorial&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTML5 Canvas Ad with TypeScript Tutorial&lt;/a&gt; and download the example files.

Sounds like there is going to be a lot of changes with TypeScript version 0.9.0. I am hoping they changed how modules are imported/referenced.]]></description>

I have done almost what you have done, but used modules as package names. 


module com.codebelt.robert

This is causing me all kinds of problems. If I am reading this correctly, there is no need for modules in this way. I can package my classes into individual TS simply reference them with the /// ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The main difference I see is how easy it is to create classes that can extend other classes. Then you are just writing JavaScript after that.

class Truck extends Vehicle {
 //Now write normal JavaScript
}

You also don&#039;t have to type out prototype on all your class functions which makes you source code smaller and cleaner to read.

TypeScript is not a new language it just adds some conventions to JavaScript like how to create a class and the ability to add types to your variables and functions. This will help in error checking and refactoring when you have an IDE that supports TypeScript.

You don&#039;t need to use types such as (private, :number, :void, etc) but these will help with code completion with an IDE like WebStorm 6 or Visual Studio. 

Download the example code and compare the typescript code to the outputted JavaScript code.]]></description>
